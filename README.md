# Supplementary Tables and Figures for Periodontitison based on oral microbiome



Our goal with this work was to find A Universal Oral Microbiome-Based Signature for Periodontitis. We we systematically evaluated the cross-cohort performance of oral microbiome-based machine-learning classifiers for Periodontitis.
